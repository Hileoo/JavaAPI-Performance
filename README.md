# JavaCollectionAPI-Performance
Evaluating the overall performance of several Java Collections data structure

Also including the visualized results  

Compared between ArrayList and HashMap, including operations for different size and location in the data structure.  

Function:  
1. Test the Temporal Complexity of insertion operations (Big-O)  
2. Compare Temporal Complexity of inserttion operation, delete operation, search operation  

Example:
